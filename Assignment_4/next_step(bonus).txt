One approach would be to perform a phylogenetic analysis. This can be done by aligning the sequences of the putative orthologues along with a set of known orthologous sequences from other related species. A phylogenetic tree can then be constructed and the putative orthologues should cluster together with the known orthologous sequences from the other related species if they are truly orthologous.

Another approach would be to examine the functional annotations of the orthologues. Orthologous genes are expected to have similar functions and therefore should have similar annotation. This can be done by comparing the Gene Ontology (GO) terms associated with the orthologues and checking whether they have similar functions.

Additionally, it could be useful to verify synteny between the orthologues in different genomes. Genes that are orthologous are expected to be located in similar genomic regions in different species. This can be done by comparing the genomic locations of the orthologues and checking whether they are located in similar regions.
